## CSS Transition has 4 basic properties
1. property (box-shadow, height, etc. pp)
2. timing (1s, 400ms, ...)
3. ease (linear, ease-in-out, ...)
4. delay (0.5s)
**combined into one transition statement -> transition: box-shadow 1s ease-in-out 1s`this is the delay`, background-color 0.5s ease**

* put Transition in component itself not the hover-state
* active for pressed button
