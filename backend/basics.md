* Applications in React need to be **build** `npm run build``
  * puts all code in one line, removes spaces where not needed

## Express
* Express.js: web framework for node.js
* 2 ways to use express, either with require or via import (which can only run in a module). It makes sense to have the same logic in front and backend, thus we use import with 2 possibilities:
  * ðŸš« The worse approach: rename file to index.mjs
  * ðŸ™Œ Better Approach: package.json, change "type" to module

```jsx
import express from 'express'

const app = express();

// --- Define Routes of Server ---
// -- Which http requests are we accepting? e.g. GET POST PUT DELETE --

// - adding a GET-Route - 
app.get('/', ()=>{
  console.log("get home page")
}) // but this does not do a request, since it runs on the server, but it â€“â€“acceptsâ€“â€“ it

// Script listens to incoming http requests
app.listen(8000, ()=>console.log('Server listening on port 8000')

// When we know send a get-Request (e.g. by going to localhost:8000) we will log "Server listening on ..." in the console

// --- Return something on the request ---
// -- enhance the get-route written before and replace it with this: --
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.sendFile()
})
// Could also directly render HTML
```
